           I think "Chrome plug-in" belongs to "productivity and quality-oriented technologies". The plug-ins are designed to add utility and convenience to the browser. The basic idea is to let developers add some minor scripts and utilities to the browser, like auto-paging, capturing the whole web page or extract Baidu Netdisk download link. This is obviously productivity-and-quality-oriented.

              A good point is that since there can be no more than 1 connection through port 80 (or 443, in case of https) at a certain time, closing the connection as soon as possible, the server can handle requests faster.
            </li>
            <li>
              A bad point is that since establishing and closing TCP or UDP connections costs extra traffic, it puts greater burden on the network.

              A server may be unable to know the exact number of browsers reading its content. Consider the case when several browsers of the same brand and version on different clients connected to a DHCP server send requests to the same server. Since their addresses and HTTP requests looks the same to the server, it's impossible for the server to decide whether these requests come from the same client.
