    <h3>This is the heading</h3>
    <p>
      I'm writing a paragraph. I'm goint to tell you that HTML5 is the fifth revision of the HTML standard (created in 1990 and standardized as HTML 4 as of 1997). It was finalized, and published, on 28 October 2014 by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Its core aims have been to improve the language with support for the latest multimedia while keeping it easily readable by humans and consistently understood by computers and devices (web browsers, parsers, etc.). HTML5 is intended to subsume not only HTML 4, but also XHTML 1 and DOM Level 2 HTML. And then, I'll create a line break, which should be displayed immediately.<br />The line break should already be displayed.

    The following code shoule divide the page to 2 parts.
    <table width="100%">

          <h3 style="text-align:center">This is the first part.</h3><br />
          The permanent members of the United Nations Security Council (also known as the Permanent Five, Big Five, or P5) are the five states which the UN Charter of 1945 grants a permanent seat on the UN Security Council (UNSC): China, France, Russia (formerly the Soviet Union), the United Kingdom, and the United States. These countries represent the five great powers considered to be the victors of World War II. A total of 15 UN member states serve on the UNSC, the remainder of which are elected. Only the five permanent members have the power of veto, which enables them to prevent the adoption of any "substantive" draft Council resolution, regardless of its level of international support.

          <h3 style="text-align:center">This is the second part.</h3><br />
          At the UN's founding in 1945, the five permanent members of the Security Council were the French Republic, the Republic of China, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States. There have been two seat changes since then, although not reflected in Article 23 of the United Nations Charter as it has not been accordingly amended.
